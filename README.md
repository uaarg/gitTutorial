gitTutorial
===========

Simple tutorial for using git for UAARG projects.

We use git for:
- Keeping track of changes to all of our software
- Writing software collaboratively, with lots of people on a team

Both of these are pretty important when writing software. You don't want to make a major change that breaks everything and have no way to go back to a working version. You also don't want to email around individual changes to your code and then end up with a mess of different versions.

git is a tool that lets you avoid that. More specifically, it's a *software version control tool*.

How do I get started?
---------------------
Clone the repository. Type this in at your command line:
`git clone https://github.com/uaarg/gitTutorial.git`

This makes a version of the repository on your computer in a new folder called gitTutorial. You can see that all of the files in the gitTutorial Github repository have been downloaded to your computer.

A **repository** is different from just a folder with a bunch of code in it because it has the full history of the project as well. Use a `git log` to see the project history.

There's a file called `names.txt` in this repo. Edit this in your favourite text editor (you can use `gedit` on Ubuntu) and add your name to the file.
